Creator's API is one of my oldest projects from my early days of programming. It's
the first scripting add-on I ever made, and the project was started in 2021. The
files in this repository might have been created just last year, but that's
because I lost my oldest copy of it. I uploaded it to serve as an archive and as
inspiration to continue my programming journey! Here's the beginning of the
original readme:



# Creatorsâ€™ API

A simple framework for Minecraft Bedrock to help you in administrating servers or
multiplayer games.

*Currently, the documentation at GitHub Pages are outdated. Please refer to the
types at the moment while I'm updating the docs.*

> **Warning**: This project is still under development, means it dosen't ready yet
 for production use.

Currently, this framework has the following features:

- Plugin API
- Events Handler

## Installing

To install the framework, download one on the [releases section][rel] and put it
on your add-on. You can import the framework or access it globally with the `creator`
namespace (only if its loaded).
